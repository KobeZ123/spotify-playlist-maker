# Spotify Interval Playlist Maker
The Spotify Interval Playlist Maker is a web application that allows a user to view their music listening profile and automatically generate an interval playlist based on recommendations selected by the user. 

# How the App Works 
First, the user needs to be authenticated with the Spotify API.  <br/>

<br/>


The user is able to view their recent and all-time listening activity by seeing their top artists and tracks! <br/>

</kbd> <br/>

The user can generate an "interval playlist" by selecting the artists, tracks, and genres that they want to have in their playlist. An algorithm is used to generate a playlist of a specified duration (or as close as possible) based on the user's selections! <br/>

The user selects styles of artists that they would like to add to their playlist. <br/>

</kbd> <br/>


  



The user selects the general vibes of their playlist by choosing genres. <br/>

</kbd> <br/>

The user names their playlist and selects a specified duration for the interval playlist. <br/>

</kbd> <br/>

The playlist is generated and directly added to the user's Spotify playlist library! Happy listening! <br/>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
